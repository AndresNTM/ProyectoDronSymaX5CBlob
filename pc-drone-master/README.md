Python OpenCV Code for Flying a Mini-Drone

The main files needed are fly_drone.py, blob_detect.py, and control_params.py

You'll need Python 2.7.x and OpenCV.  You may need to adjust the COM port for
the Arduino connection and the videocamera id to get the right camera.

The code is still sort of a mess; but it's working!
